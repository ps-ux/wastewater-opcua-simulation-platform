Influent Pump Station (IPS)

The IPS​ consists of a dividable wet well labeled North and South. There are four pumps drawing from the North Wet Well and three pumps drawing from the South Wet Well. The purpose of the influent pumps is to transfer raw sewage from the north and south wet wells to the Headworks Building.

The process is controlled by PLC 1 located in the Influent Pump Station ground level. Please reference the control loop descriptions for additional details.

The firm capacity of the IPS is approximately 182 MGD with the total pumping capacity approximately 216 MGD. Firm capacity is defined as the capacity with the largest pump out of service. The Aloha 3, River Road and Dawson Creek Pump Stations pump directly to the headworks header and bypass the IPS. Additionally, the Aloha 3 and River Road Pump Station transfer flows can be routed to the IPS Wetwell via the Pipeline Valves outside the pump Station. During wet weather high flow events, operators may receive a request to reroute the Aloha 3 flow to the IPS wet well in order to gain additional capacity at that remote pump station and prevent an overflow. However, remote pump station flows are normally configured to go directly to the distribution header in the headworks building.

There are a total of seven influent pumps at the IPS.  Five of the pumps are identical in design and function.  They are located in spots 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7.  All are heavy-duty, vertical open line shaft, dry pit, single-suction, non-clog, centrifugal pumps. These pumps are matched with medium voltage, adjustable frequency drives for continuous 24-hour duty at any speed within the specified range. These five pumps are 900 HP and rated at 34.5 MGD.  The two smaller pumps, also centrifugal pumps, are 400 HP and rated at 22 MGD each.

Two separate force mains receive the discharge from the IPS. They are both 54 inch diameter lines going to the Headworks Building.  Each line has a magnetic flow meter to record the influent flow through the IPS.  These two force mains can be operated separately or in common.

 Influent Pump Station - Odor Control

The Influent Pump Station (IPS) odor control system removes odors from the North and South IPS wetwells, the influent distribution box, and the 72" influent pipe. The spaces are designed to be kept at a negative pressure as fresh air is drawn in from two large snorkel type inlets with backdraft dampers on the north and south wet well. There's one small fresh air inlet with backdraft damper on the influent distribution box access hatch.

Foul air removal from each space is balanced with control dampers located inside the IPS fan room, adjacent to the makeup air unit. The foul air is conveyed to a grease filter that is monitored for differential pressure to track and alert when filter maintenance is required.

Two fans (Aerovent) with sound enclosures operate in a LEAD/STANDBY mode, and are equipped with variable frequency drives (VFDs) that adjust fan speed to maintain a consistent air flow rate of 6,000-8,000 CFM to the CALGON Phoenix-8000 odor treatment unit. Low negative inlet air pressure will alert operations to potential trouble conditions such as open hatches or damaged ductwork. High pressure on the discharge will alert operations to potential trouble conditions like carbon media fouling or plugging of the CALGON Phoenix-8000.

Odor treatment is accomplished by a "CALGON Phoenix-8000 water regenerated activated carbon system". The "water regenerated activated carbon system" utilizes individual carbon canisters filled with catalytic granular activated carbon. Foul air is directed through the 40 canisters that are housed in chambers which adsorb H2S (foul air) and convert it to H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), a water soluble compounds. Adsorption is defined as the adhesion of atoms, ions or molecules from a gas, liquid or dissolved solid to a surface. Once the carbon is spent, a solenoid valve opens and allows water to fill one chamber at a time, washing the carbon and restoring it's adsorption capacity. The system remains online during water regeneration. It is expected that each chamber is backwashed once every 3 days. Over time the carbon loses it's adsorption capacity and the canisters must be replaced. System experience has indicated that the canisters need replacement every 12-18 months if operating properly. To ensure proper operation, the CALGON Phoenix-8000 must be maintained at the designated air flow rate of 6000-8000 CFM.

The purpose of the IPS Odor Control System is to eliminate nuisance odors from the two wet wells and one inlet box by keeping these spaces under a 0.1" WC (0.1 inches of water column) negative pressure.

Foul air is pulled from the wetwells by a fan that sends the odorous air to the Phoenix Odor Control Unit. Nuisance odors from the two wet wells and inlet box are eliminated by keeping these spaces under a negative pressure. This water regenerated activated carbon system removes 99% of (H2S) hydrogen sulfide. Odorous air ductwork is fiberglass reinforced pipe (FRP) and is routed from the wet wells and inlet box to the odorous air fan then to the odor control system. Odorous air dampers are provided in order to adjust and balance flow rates. The unit is equipped with an odorous air stack that terminates above inlets to prevent contaminants from entering through the nearby HVAC inlets. Fresh air inlets are provided at the top of the wet wells and inlet box for allowing proper airflow. Each inlet is provided with backdraft dampers to maintain a negative pressure in the space and prevent odor leakage when the system is temporarily taken off-line.

Headworks - Bar Screens

Wastewater from the two 54-inch force mains, Forest Grove/Hillsboro and remote pump stations come together in a 72-inch header in the Headworks Building and is then split into the online influent screenings channels.

There are a total of six influent screenings channels available.  The channels are either 48 inches wide rated at 50 MGD (four total) or 72 inches wide rated at 100 MGD (two total). The channels have a designed water surface depth of approximately 12 feet. Parkson in-channel fine bar screens with 1/8-inch openings are installed in two of the channels (channels 3&4) providing a total of 100 MGD capacity. These screens operate continuously with variable speed drives and have two speeds - low and high. The speed of the screen is controlled based on the water level upstream and downstream and the differential level across the screen.

Huber in-channel multi-rake bar screens with 1/4-inch openings are installed in the two 72-inch-wide channels (channels 2&5) providing a total of 200 MGD of capacity. These screens operate cyclically depending on a preset upstream/downstream level differential with variable-speed drive and is operator adjustable at the local HMI. 

Each screen discharges the collected screenings to a common sluiceway that conveys the screenings to two washer/compactors. The sluiceway has sluicing/push water to help convey the screenings.

The washer/compactors wash the screenings to remove organic material and then dewater and compact the screenings. The liquid from each washer/compactor is routed to influent channel 1 or influent channel 2 depending on which valves are opened and closed. The washer/compactor unit is automatically controlled from the programmable logic controller (PLC) provided with the vendor equipment package.

The screenings washer/compactors convey the material to a screenings hopper that collects the compacted material and discharges it to dumpsters. The hoppers are equipped with discharge gates. The gates are normally controlled by the operator either locally or through supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) terminals. A hauling company is hired to pick the boxes up twice/week.

Two monorails are installed for removal of the washer/compactors. One of the monorails is manual and one is electric. The electric operator has a remote control and can be used to lower equipment to grade on the west side of the headworks building. 

A hot water generation system is installed for cleaning and de-greasing the washer/compactors. The hot water system is controlled manually at the local control panel. ​

Headworks - Grit

The primary sludge contains the settleable grit and is pumped to the grit removal equipment by the Primary Sludge Pumps. Grit is removed using two vortex grit separators. Grit from the separator underflow is discharged to a grit classifier, where it is dewatered and loaded into the units hopper that weighs the grit. The overflow from the grit separator discharges to the primary degritted sludge wet well for pumping to the sludge screens. Grit Classifier effluent containing suspended inorganic/organic material and floating grease goes to plant drain.

Headworks - Sludge Screens

Primary degritted sludge contains fibrous and plastic materials, which are removed by sludge screens. Primary degritted sludge is pumped to the sludge screens from the primary degritted sludge wet well. There are three sludge screens; each capable of receiving 525 gpm. A sludge screen is a horizontal in-line coarse material separator. The feed from the inlet enters the center of the screening zone, where the coarse material is retained on the inner surface of a perforated screen, then transported to the pressing zone and onwards to the discharge point by an Archimedean screw. Compacted coarse material discharges into a hopper. The hopper gates stay open when dumpster is in place below. These gates should only be closed when the dumpster is removed, if left closed for too long material can back up and fail the screening unit. The screened primary degritted sludge then flows to the Gravity Thickeners/Fermenters by gravity.​

Headworks - Odor Control

The odor control system is a single stage chemical packed tower unit.  Packed tower scrubbers are one of the most common forms of wet scrubbers used for odor control in municipal wastewater treatment plants. Odor constituents including H2S, ammonia, and various organic sulfur compounds may be reduced to very low levels after going through the system. The objective is to reduce odors offsite to between 5-50ppbV; which is historically the concentration range where odor nuisance and subsequent complaints occur.

The single stage system is designed to remove up to 99% of the hydrogen sulfide and 50-80% of the various reduced organic sulfur compounds in the odorous air stream. Since other odorous constituents may exist in the future, space was made available for future second stage scrubbers or future dual bed carbon towers as necessary.

Odorous air fans are housed in a separate odor control room for noise isolation.  Scrubber basins and chemical systems are located in the gallery in order to prevent freezing. Sodium hypochlorite and Sodium hydroxide is supplied to the odor system's day tanks located near the base of the towers. The day tanks are tied to a control loop that calls for fills when a low level is reached. When the low level is reached, the loop opens two automated valves on the delivery line and powers up the corresponding transfer pump to deliver the needed chemical. The bulk systems are located in the East Chemical Building.

Two packed tower systems are provided to serve the Headworks Building and the circular Primary Clarifiers. The original design was for dedicated towers for each process area. The two systems are tied together on the inlet and discharge sides of the odor control fans to allow partial treatment of both systems when one scrubber or one fan is down for maintenance.

The Headworks Building packed tower odor control system will remove odors from the headworks screen enclosures, truck load out area, channels, vortex grit classifier, hoppers, degritted sludge wet well. The headworks odor control fan speed automatically adjusts to the motor actuated damper position located in the truck load out area.

The entire truck load out area is ventilated at 15 air changes per hour (ACH). In order to minimize odorous airflow rates and subsequent operating costs, enclosures have been provided over screens and vortex grit classifiers. Enclosures and hoppers are ventilated at approximately 20 ACH. Channels are ventilated to maintain minimum sweep velocities of 50 fpm. The Degritted Sludge Wet Well is ventilated at 12 ACH.

The Primary Clarifier packed tower odor control system will remove odors from the Primary Clarifiers at 9,000 SCFM per clarifier to maintain minimum sweep velocities of 50 fpm. The total airflow is 27,000 CFM.

The Headworks FRP odorous air fan and motor is sized for 29,400 CFM. However, sheaves and belts are available to provide for changing or future conditions.

Headworks - Sep​tage Receiving

The Rock Creek Facility operates a receiving station for septic tank pumpers and chemical toilet waste. Previously, haulers discharged into a simple underground pit and submitted manual load tickets. In 2024, the system was upgraded and relocated just south of the influent pump station. The new automated system, provided by Flowpoint, requires haulers to enter an access code and PIN to initiate the unloading process. An automated valve controls the inlet, and a flow meter tracks the volume of waste received.
